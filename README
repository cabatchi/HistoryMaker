HistoryMaker Documentation (yes it’s just EveCaptcha but washed)

First things first, download python 3 
https://www.python.org/downloads/
Open CMD (scroll down)


Install required modules by typing “pip install modulegoeshere” (without quotations)
PyInstaller,altgraph,bs4,certifi,chardet,easy_install,future,idna,libfuturize,libpasteurize,macholib,names,ordlookup,past,pefile,peutils,pip,pkg_resources,pyfiglet,requests,selenium 
Idk what modules exactly so just download all of them lol
If something is giving you an already installed error, then it probably is installed



Download the Historymaker script and historywords.txt from here.
Download both of them to the SAME FOLDER
Navigate to the folder you’ve downloaded them in cmd by doing cd folderhere
Type “python ‘historymaker.py’” (without the double quotes)
